# AI-Text-Summarizer ensures users are prompted to insert text they wish to summarize.
The user can submit their text with a “summarize” button and receive an AI-powered summary in an output text area.
#This app  has a client-side (website), server-side, and external API integration to Hugging Face.

The Postman AI Text Summarizer course
## Introduction
Welcome to the Project-Based Learning module on building an AI-powered text summarizer web app! Throughout this module, we'll walk you through the process of creating a robust text summarization application using Node.js, Replit or GitHub Codespaces, the Hugging Face Inference API, and Postman. You'll not only explore real-world APIs but also generate code and customize your app with newfound skills.

By the end of this module, you'll be adept at using Postman to incorporate APIs into your applications seamlessly.
## Skills development
Skills you'll be using and developing:

Build and deploy a full-stack app on Replit/ GitHub Codespaces using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Node.js
Explore real-world APIs with Postman, including the Hugging Face Inference API for text summarization with AI
Use Postman to generate code and integrate APIs into an application

 #Do you encounter any challenge
If you encounter challenges, we recommend completing the Postman Student Expert training before starting this module. For additional assistance, feel free to reach out on the Postman Student Community Discord or via email at studentprogram@postman.com.

# Project Motivation

Created this project, since Replit has recently shut down an alternative to Replit is GitHub CodeSpaces. Contributions are welcomed.
NB : This template is adopted from Replit Postman AI Text Summarizer Template, due to efforts of enabling using alternatives such as GitHub Codespaces
